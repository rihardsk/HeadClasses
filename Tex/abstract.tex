The work explores the language classes that arise with respect to the head count of a finite automaton. The results for deterministic non-deterministic and probabilistic automata are explored and similar results are proved for two-way ultrametric automata, which are viewed as a generalization of ultrametric finite automata that have just recently been introduced in 2012 by R\= usi\c n\v s Freivalds. For the one-way setting it is shown that ultrametric one-head finite automata are more powerful than deterministic and non-deterministic automata for certain languages. Definitions for ultrametric Turing machines and ultrametric multi-register machines are introduced as a tool for proving the results. An interesting result regarding multi-tape automata is shown as well.
